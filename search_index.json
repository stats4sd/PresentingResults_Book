An ineffective visualisation of data can communicate a very misleading message. Building skills in data visualisation can help you to understand and see important results in other peoples tables, graphs, and maps. This is in addition to enabling you to create informative visualisations of your own. The aim of this chapter is to provide some principles behind making good data visualisations. This guide is intended for anyone who wishes to develop their data visualisation and reporting skills. The advice presented here will be applicable to a wide variety of situations and is not specific to certain topics. Additionally, we hope that users of all ability levels will be able to take this advice to mind in their future projects and their everyday interactions with data. [add some more points here - bullet pointed??] 3.4 Principles of data visualisation Through developing your data visualisation skills, you can generate a wide variety of graphical/cartographic/tabular representations of data. This could be anything from simple bar graphs and line graphs to complicated cartograms. However, regardless of the complexity of your chosen data visualisation technique, there are certain principles that should always be followed: 3.4.1 Effectiveness By effectiveness, we mean you should be ensuring that you are using the right type of visualisation for your objectives and priorities. This is the first crucial step in making sure what you produce is effective at displaying the message you intend to show. If you pick the wrong method, your visualisation will not be effective regardless of its quality. Maps are of course for displaying data which have some form of geographic component. Tables are suited for presenting structured numerical information; consider tables of means across some groups, frequencies, or some statistical information. This makes them ideal for when the message is in the specific numbers and potentially the relationship between them. Graphs are quite multi-purpose; there is a type of graph for almost any message you could be wanting to convey. In general, we would choose to use them for indicating trends, making broad comparisons, or showing relationships. For instance, the pie chart below is completely unnecessary. While it is looks fine, the information is not being shown well by the use of a graph, certainly not by a pie chart. This is not helped by there being far too many colours and countries. The more effective way to display this information would be a table. An Unnecessary Pie Chart 3.4.2 Readability All elements of your visualisation should be legible, understandable, and coherent. In a word, readable. While this largely relates to any textual elements of your visualisations, the principle is applicable to the whole visualisation. This includes having titles and headings which concisely explain the content. It should be informative without being overly long and confusing. The same goes for any further labels such as axis labels for graphs, column headings for tables and geographic labels on a map. Details to consider mentioning include measurement units, geographical coverage, time, the source of the data and any relevant statistics. Of course, the elements of a visualisation will vary depending on what visual you produce, but they should always be easy to read and understand. You can achieve this by avoiding language beyond the scope of your target audience, providing the necessary information needed to read your visual and presenting the element in a simple and tidy manner. You will find further guidance on specific elements in each of the subsequent sections of this guide. The example below makes a simple error. In an attempt to stop overlapping axis labels, the text size has been reduced to be far too small. A much simpler solution would have been to swap the x and y axis over. We are also missing a title and the y axis is uninformative. Too small to read the labels Much easier to read 3.4.3 Tidiness A visualisation should never be cluttered. This follows on from readability, although more specifically relates to positioning and spacing of elements as well as avoiding using unnecessary elements. This includes making sure no elements are overlapping; there should be adequate spacing between them without there being so much that it makes the visualisation look empty. This can also be described as making good use of white space. There is much more to be said on this topic, but these are mostly specific to the type of visualisation you are using. The general principle of ensuring your visual is neat and organised is always applicable. 3.4.4 Informative A good data visualisation serves to succinctly show a message about our findings. We aim to inform our reader. Usually, it would be accompanied by some text which helps to interpret the visualisation, placing it into a wider context or providing more formal details such as the results of a relevant statistical analysis. However, a good data visualisation should be self-explanatory and should be able to serve as a stand-alone piece. The reader should be able to understand the message without constantly referring to the text. Much of this can be accomplished by sticking to the particulars of keeping your visual tidy and readable. Whenever creating a table, graph, or a map, you should include the source of the information from which the visualisation was created. This aids the credibility of your visualisation but also ensures a properly informed audience. An exception is when all information that is used for visualisations in a report comes from the same source. In this case, you should clearly indicate the source in advance of your visualisations. This also means making sure that your visual is necessary in the first place. Consider the following: Can you achieve the same message with some simple text? Can a visualisation accurately demonstrate your results, or would it be distracting? Are your results too complex to visualise in isolation? The example below makes an easy mistake in which by trying to provide too much information the plot actually becomes very difficult to read and therefore fairly uninformative as its difficult to learn anything from it. It is far too tasking to look at so many relationships at once so nothing is learned from this. Plus there are some difficult concepts being used with no understanding of measurement so this graph would not make sense out of context. Far too many variables Much better 3.4.5 Accessibility Accessibility has become an increasingly important aspect of data presentation in recent years. Ensuring good practice in accessibility will help in getting an even wider audience to see our research and use our results. The Government Statistical Service makes content accessible to those with impairments to their vision, hearing, mobility, and thinking/understanding skills. For our purposes, we are mostly concerned with visual impairments. There are some general principles on accessibility, including making sure you explain any uncommon abbreviations, avoiding clutter and keeping information concise. However, we are focusing on the use of colour. Further guidance on this is included in the accessibility section of this document. This includes considerations of colour blindness, cultural context, and the use of saturation/hue/luminance. It is quite easy to forget to consider how our visualisations may appear to other people. The example below shows you just how different your visualisation may look to someone who suffers from visual impairments such as colour blindness. Left - a normal looking graph, Right - What it looks like to a colour blind person 3.4.6 Consistency This is mostly relevant when you are intending to use multiple visualisations across your report. When doing so, it is important to ensure you maintain a level of internal consistency. This involves many aspects. For instance, if you intend to disaggregate your visuals by the levels of a variable, pay attention to the order you put these categories in. They should be kept to a logical or ascending/descending order and this order should be kept the same for the sake of consistency and readability. The same goes for when using colours to indicate certain characteristics of the data; keep the meaning of the colours consistent. Of course, this is also important for all the smaller details such as the font, size and face (bold/italic) of text. In essence, try to keep the formatting between visualisations as similar as possible. Generate your personal visual style and stick to it. Changing things up too much will just confuse your audience and reduce your visuals readability. The example below unnecessary changes the order of the y axis and changes the meanning of the colours. While the graphs are okay as stand alone pieces, together they diminish the effectiveness of the whole visualisation.

Often this will result from conducting a factorial treatment experiment, for example a randomised complete block design looking at whether yield varies across 5 different varieties of a crop, with 3 different levels of nitrogen fertiliser used. However the same principles are common to any analysis where we are wishing to compare the effects of multiple factors all at once, where they are designed treatments or observed responses from a survey. Whenever visualising results across multiple factors we should be thinking of ways to clearly and effectively show the impacts of all of these different factors; rather than simply highlighting best or the worst. In some cases, particularly considering a classic factorial experiment, the design of the trial itself provides a framework for how we should be visualising the results. In others there may be multiple options, some of which we can determine to be more effective than others, 4.3 Video 4.4 Overall principles A key principle to bear in mind always is that there is never only one correct way to present results. But there definitely lots of incorrect or extremely ineffective ways. Even following a set of principles a certain amount of iteration and trial and error of different plot configurations will help the thought process and ensure that you are choosing a sensible and effective plot to convey your message. Dont expect to immediately land on the best answer. What is effective depends on a few criteria: * The message or objectives. The same data can be presented in different ways to highlight different trends. * The design or structure of the data. Consider how many different variables you have, and how many response levels are in those variables, and what sort * The actual observed data - this will inform scales, transformations and may lead you into presenting results in multiple different plots, or all in a single plot. * The intended audience - a plot for publication in a journal is unlikely to be as effective if used in a presentation for a conference. And a technical audience will look for different things, and have different expectations when looking at a plot to a more general audience. 4.5 Example Data The following apply to any response that is measured on experimental units, even if we usually think of a continuous variable typified by yield. We are going to use some simulated data in this document to show the process for comparing yield across a factorial experiment. The design incorporates two treatment factors - Type (A, B or C) and Inputs (0, 100 or 200). There were 20 farmers who all included the 9 treatment combinations. The 20 farmers are split across 3 sites (X, Y and Z) and we may also be interested in assessing the gender of the farmer (Male or Female). 4.6 Key ideas Response to stimulus or input is observed at discrete levels of a factor. In the example dataset we have a factorial experiment where the response is yield and the designed treatment factors we are considering are the combinations of type and inputs. We have 9 combinations or treatments in total: three levels of type and three levels of inputs, and 20 observations of each combination coming from the 20 farms. Therefore we have 9 mean yield values, and 9 distributions of yield, that we need to compare to be able to assess the results. Simply looking at the numbers in a table, or in a plot displayed as if these 9 treatments as independent is going to be a poor representation of the results. The numbers and plot will allow us simply to identify the highest (C/200) and lowest (b/0) treatment combinations. But it will not allow us to make any inferences easily about the overall effects of type and inputs, or the interactions between them. Type Inputs n Mean Yield SD Yield A 0 20 8.6 3.3 A 100 20 10.6 3.6 A 200 20 11.2 5.1 B 0 20 7.7 3.1 B 100 20 10.3 3.3 B 200 20 10.6 2.7 C 0 20 8.8 3.9 C 100 20 10.4 4.5 C 200 20 13.9 5.2 A conventional one-factor plot. The response on the y axis and the input or stimulus or irsk factor on the x axis. We could seperate out the two factors and produce seperate plots for each. This would be more informative than what we see in stage 1, since we could more easily gain an understanding of the impacts of each factor. However it would be an extremely limited interpretation by ignoring the secondary factors. In most cases the interaction between factors will be of most interest. We want to understand if the impact of factor x and factor y are operating independently or if they in some way modify each other. The easiest way to understand this is through investigation of whether the trends are parallel. Parallel lines in an interaction plot suggest there is no interaction between the variables. Non-parallel lines, whether they diverge or cross, indicate there is an interaction. The ability to assess this is another reason why using lines is a much more visually powerful way to illustrate trends than using bars. The interaction of Inputs X Type is the same as the interaction of Type X Inputs, and the presentation provides identical information. But the way we interpret and read the plots is not the same. We may find it easier to read one particular orientation over the other. Or both orientations may be useful to highlight particular patterns which only become clearer when the positioning of the elements is reversed. It will depend on the results, and the variables themselves whether one will be more effective or whether both may be possiblities. There may not be only one way to present. If there are more than two factors the same applies but more choices now and higher order interactions hard to interpret. Two choices: We could consider combing two factors together, if they are seen as being of equal importance, and have one line for each combination of factors. But this quickly becomes hard to interpret. If there are two factors of primary interest, where the third is a modifying variable or different context, then it makes sense to use facets. In the example data we have this exact case - with Inputs and Types being our variables of primary interest, and Site being a contextual variable. Therefore plotting into multiple facets allows us to compare whether the relationships within the experiment (Input by Type) vary by the location of the experiment. In practice, the observations on the graph come with uncertainty in their position. Part of the function of statistical analysis is to estimate the uncertainty so that (a) it can also be represented on the graph (b) we can separate pattern that is noise (possibly just due to random, unrepeatable variation) from that which is signal (repeatable, consistent across repetitions). ## Warning: Computation failed in `stat_summary()`: ## Hmisc package required for this function If the effect of one or more factors is considered noise then we can average over them and display main effects. In all of the presentations so far we have averaged over at least one of the factors to illustrate a point. But when putting the final story together we need to consider which factors are important. We should also be looking to our formal statistical analysis for guidance here, by considering which factors we have sufficient evidence to conclude are components of significant interactions. If the variables themselves are significant, but interactions are not, then averaging over these variables will be OK in terms of representing the key effects. ## Type III Analysis of Variance Table with Satterthwaite&#39;s method ## Sum Sq Mean Sq NumDF DenDF F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Inputs 251.632 251.632 1 130.000 50.7049 6.536e-11 *** ## Type 9.814 4.907 2 130.000 0.9888 0.374804 ## Site 34.314 17.157 2 19.068 3.4572 0.052346 . ## Gender 1.040 1.040 1 19.068 0.2095 0.652296 ## Inputs:Type 22.160 11.080 2 130.000 2.2326 0.111343 ## Inputs:Site 49.803 24.902 2 130.000 5.0178 0.007958 ** ## Type:Site 57.372 14.343 4 130.000 2.8902 0.024828 * ## Inputs:Gender 0.232 0.232 1 130.000 0.0467 0.829242 ## Type:Gender 13.131 6.566 2 130.000 1.3230 0.269891 ## Site:Gender 20.350 10.175 2 19.068 2.0503 0.156131 ## Inputs:Type:Site 71.161 17.790 4 130.000 3.5848 0.008297 ** ## Inputs:Type:Gender 4.941 2.470 2 130.000 0.4978 0.609017 ## Inputs:Site:Gender 16.643 8.321 2 130.000 1.6768 0.190987 ## Type:Site:Gender 19.253 4.813 4 130.000 0.9699 0.426402 ## Inputs:Type:Site:Gender 8.019 2.005 4 130.000 0.4040 0.805502 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 In this case our analysis suggests Gender is not a statistically significant factor, but Inputs, Type, Site and all of the interactions between these variables are statistically significant. Therefore we should reflect that in our final plot - not showing the interactions between the three factors will be misleading, but averaging over gender will not cause any issues. 4.7 Shiny 4.8 The general process 4.8.1 Step 1: Set out the objectives, message or hypothesis for the story you want to tell with the graph you are designing There may be several messages from the same data set, so think which it is. Using the same graph for multiple purposes may sometimes be possible, but using multiple well constructed graphs will likely do a better job of illustrating these different messages. It does not really matter which factors are strictly treatments (randomised in the design) and which are unrandomized context factors (eg location) or observed characteristics. These maks a difference to the statistical analysis and the nature of inference, but not to the drawing of graphs. Likewise, complexities in layout (eg Is it split-plot design? Where there incomplete blocks? Is it a survey?) will affect the statistics, and maybe the calculation of the estimates being plotted, but not to the general design of the graphs. Experiments often have treatment structure that is partially or not-quite a factorial, if not all treatment combinations are present. Or there may be very poorly estimated combinations with just a few observations where the plots may be misleading if they were to be included. Thats OK  most of what is here still applies but there might be a few points that are not there or extras added. Only showing a subset of the data to focus on the specific comparisons is also a good strategy to focus the message of the plot, without the additional confusion of incomplete or very low sample size combinations. image5 4.8.2 Step 2: Remember experiments are set up to make comparisons Generally the absolute value of y is less important than differences. Average rarely exists in reality, farmers are unlikely to obtain the average value of yield, but a comparison of efficacy (A will likely yield better than B) is more generalisable and more applicable. 4.8.3 Step 3: Maintain the visual metaphor One core rule of all graphics, we want to make the way the plot is read intuitive and make sure the audience needs to refer to the axes as little as possible to understand what is being displayed. So we break the rule of response on the vertical axis with something like this: If the horizontal axis is quantitative then the order is natural. If it is qualitative try to find an ordering that adds some value eg  order by level of another variable, by some property of the category. Definitely do not just keep the data order, which is likely to be nothing more than purely alphabetical. In the example data we saw earlier re-ordering the sites to go from lowest to highest average yields will provide a much easier and clearer interpretation than the arbitrary alphabetical order. 4.8.4 Step 4: Lines Even where levels of the factor are discrete joining points together shows up which points are logically connected and the concept of interaction = non-parallel become visual. Bars are an extremely poor choice of visualisation tool for showing means, variability and comparisons across multiple factors. There use should be limited solely to percentages and frequencies, and even then only when there is a single factor being displayed. 4.8.5 Step 5: Multiple factors More than factors is actually common, even if there are only two treatments when you consider location, year are often there. It would be natural to have an aim of looking at the what response to F is modified by A and whether that is the same each season (S) and local (L) 4.8.6 Step 6: Colours and symbols Remember you can vary colour, symbol, line style. So if we do choose to plot three factors, with two factors combining to form the lines, a better option would be to have the two factors represented through different aesthetic elements. 4.8.7 Step 7: Facets Facets to can make it easier to display even up to four variables simultaneously if we also use a gridded facet layout - e.g. main interaction of interest showing Type by Inputs; but with row facets corresponding to gender and column facets corresponding to location. 4.8.8 Step 9: Next steps Talking to researchers about real experiments almost always leads to discussion about response to one factor (often known) be modified by one or more others. The challenge: find examples where that is not the case! Statistical significance v practice significance e.g. a graph of main effects might be useful even if there is statistically significant interaction as long as it is small. But in general if there is a significant interaction we should be looking to display this and not overlook it for the sake of finding an easy answer. Representing uncertainty. The standard error bars on means are actually meaningless for most experimental data. SEDs and CIs of differences better but only easy for neat experiments.

But we always have to bear in mind the levels of uncertainty we have in those trends, and the underlying variability that will exist around those trends. So it is important to consider how we could incorporate these ideas of precision and variability into the way we present our results to assist our audience by providing as much relevant context to the results as we can. 5.3 Video 5.4 Precision vs Variability When considering this topic we need to be clear on the difference between precision and variability. Although these concepts are related, they tell us two different things both of which are important: Precision refers to the uncertainty in the estimates or statistics that we calculate from our data. As the amount of data we have increases the amount of precision we have increases. For example - if we were trying to estimate mean household size based on a sample size of 1, then the precision in that mean would be extremely low. But if we had a sample size of 10,000 households we could estimate the mean from then we would have a much more precise estimate. Variability refers to the underlying variability in the sample, and in the population. This is not impacted by increasing the sample size, other than that increasing the sample size will increase the precision in our estimates of variability! 5.5 Precision 5.5.1 Confidence intervals vs. standard errors 5.5.2 In tables 5.5.3 Around trends 5.5.4 Overload of error bars? 5.6 Variability 5.6.1 Plots which can display variability 5.6.1.1 Boxplots/Violin Plots 5.6.1.2 Histograms 5.6.1.3 Cumulative Frequency Plots 5.6.1.4 Scatter plots 5.6.2 In tables.

These could be shown off in many different settings. Large scientific (inter-disciplinary) conferences Smaller conferences devoted mostly to your field Social media channels such as Twitter Small online meetings with fixed presentation schedules Blogs Other online settings such as Miro Regardless of the setting, the sharing of research posters is designed to be a learning experience for both the presenter and the audience. For the presenter, Share their research with the wider academic community Engage directly with their colleagues Receive feedback from their peers Develop their presentation and communication skills Networking opportunities For the audience, Learn about the research currently happening within their community Engage directly with their colleagues Potentially gain insights which could aid in their own research Networking opportunities 8.3 Key principles 8.3.1 The importance of design and layout Crucial to ensuring the effectiveness of your poster and making sure you are calable of attracting an audience for your poster. For a virtual conference, you may not have to fight for an audience but you still will need to keep their attention and keep them interested. An inaccessible or poor design can be very off putting. Put your sections into a logical flow so the audience knows where to read Avoid the dreaded Wall of text Avoid clutter, keep it tidy Avoid using images as a background Keep your colours and text consistent Always think carefully about what might be expected by your audience and what might keep them entertained. If possible, always reach out for feedback on a draft before creating a final poster.Friends, family, colleagues, supervisors, anyone. There are a couple base design types that have become common over the years. Traditional Design Traditional Poster Example Auothr: Alex Thomson (Note: Crude example of design, not all text is relevant) Each section within individual text boxes arranged into 2/3 columns oriented portrait or landscape. This traditional design dominates most poster conferences and will likely be the most common format for any template posters you find online. Strengths Useful for audiences requiring lots of detail Requires little application of creative/graphic design Easy to read and follow the order The basis for most templates Weaknesses Can appear lazy simply because of how common this format is Often encourages the Wall of text Requires creativity in order to make this stand out Gaining attention relies more heavily on the title and imagery Common for people to just copy and paste from report into a template when using this design Traditional Poster Design template #betterposter design Suggested by American PhD student Mike Morrison in a series of videos critical of the traditional approach and design to posters. This has become a larger campaign being take up in real world applications and with plans in the works to conduct full studies into its efficacy. The approach takes a user experience approach to poster design to increase the size of a potential audience, improve readability and more memorable. This is done by putting overwhelming emphasis on the key findings and results with these taking up the majority of the space on the page. This is put in the center in plain language, supplemented by imagery, with information bars either side. The left panel (silent presenter) bullet points much of the normal information you would expect to find. While the right panel (ammo bar) is filed with additional information that find the study particularly interesting and largely used when the presenter is answering questions. #betterposter Example Author: Alex Thomson Strengths Avoids overloading the reader with information. Strongly limits the word count. Simple design to work with. QR codes can be included to link to copies of the poster, the study and contact details. Attracts the audience in with a key interesting statement. Tends to be written in more plain language than other posters, ignoring scientific jargon. More approachable to a wider variety of people. Less information means more likely to be remembered by the audience. Weaknesses Mostly designed for in-person conferences. QR code being included assumes there are additional resources to link to. Not always the case. To a more critical audience, may appear simple and reductive. Still a new approach so may be a off-putting to some stuck in traditional ways Assumes you have a key finding to present. May not be as appropriate for posters not designed for studies or those which prioritise methods Ammo bar assumes presence of a knowledgeable presenter Although you do not have to follow its format exactly if you do not feel comfortable using it. The principles behind its creation are sound and should be considered regardless of your design. Using a user design experience approach, the campaign suggests; Limiting the amount of information presented. Focus on the most important information. Making the poster easier and quicker to read Making the experience more useful to the audience, less information means they can make the most out of their time and look at more posters Removing any barriers to your poster. Things that will stop someone from wanting to read it. There will be other ways to achieve these same goals. #betterposter template Infographics Infographics are posters designed to provide lots of information and facts to the audience. Or alternatively to visually display some kind of theory/principle in an interesting way. Usually requires high levels of creative design over graphics and images. Usually with the help of a graphic designer. Can help in generating discussion of a complex subject. Could be useful in providing context of an upcoming study, generating an argument for the importance of an upcoming study or reporting the initial descriptive results from a large survey. Assumes generally you have lots and lots of interesting numbers, results and facts to tell the audience. Or a theory which is easy to show off visually. Can be off-putting to supply the audience with so much information at once. Source of infographic: Visual.ly Be creative Your options are not limited to these ideas. Always be thinking about how you could be creative Your choices can be expanded or constrained by the setting and rules of your poster session. Consider the follwing questions and ideas Are you allowed interactive elements? Screens? Could include video Handouts? Physical models? Are they displayed on screens or paper? on screens could be turned into an animated presentation Is it a virtual conference? Do you have a scheduled presentation slot? If so, engagement more reliant on your presentation skills and content over design Is it on twitter? Think about how you can use the medium to your advantage Promote yourself and your poster Could animate your poster as a GIF Use the text to include additional contextual information not on the poster 8.3.2 Keep it short and simple Avoid the temptation to summarise every little thing about your study. You should be thinking about your poster as a visual abstract. Something to advertise your research and your skills. Focus on just one or two key messages about your study This could be key findings or interesting innovations/applications of your methodology Prioritise including information that the audience needs to know first Only include information on the poster that is relevant to these key messages You may have the chance to highlight other parts of your study when asked questions by audience members It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove Antoine de Saint Exupery1 Use this quote as a guiding rule. Always ask yourself what is needed, relevant, and engaging. There is no set rule when it comes to a word count although the rules of your session/conference may dictate one which you should follow. Some resources will say keep it under 1,000 words2 Others around 300 - 8003 One guide even suggests restricting yourself down to just 2504 The best advice that can be given here is to consider how much you are comfortable saying and how much it is you have to say, as well as think about what might the audience be expecting. The following sections are the standard parts to include for a research poster although what you need to include may depend on your purpose and how far along in your study you are. Introduction Make this something quick to grab the readers attention Let them know why they should keep reading Get across the point and relevance of your study Perhaps draw them in with a hypothesis/research question Methods/Approach To some this may actually be the most interesting part, especially if your method is quite innovative if so, be sure to give this section great attention so you can explain why your method is special Otherwise, keep this section brief to focus on your findings and interpretations Where possible, display your approach through a diagram or pictures. Especially if the study was an experimental design or a trial Results This will likely take up more space on the poster than any other section Only include the most interesting and relevant findings Dont include anything that doesnt need to be there Unless your study was using qualitative data analysis, this section will likely include only short sentences Use graphs, maps, and tables which help to illustrate the key findings and messages Discussion/Conclusion Some will choose to separate these two into different sections Focus only on interpreting your most relevant and interesting results Try to explain what your findings mean in plain language. The audience will want to know why your results are important and interesting References Always to be included if you reference any material on your poster Keep this small and to the bottom of the page Acknowledgements Acknowledge your institution, employer, tutors and any colleagues who aided you. Good to provide contact details to keep up engagement after the session 8.3.3 Make it engaging If your poster is displayed at a conference, in person or online, you may be fighting for attention with hundreds of other posters within a limited time frame. You must attract and engaging. Think about your poster as an advert for your research. What can you include to draw in potential customers?, how can you make them remember you? This will come down to both your presentation and design of your poster as well as the interactions you have with your audience. Tips to engage with your presentation Grab them with your title. Consider making the title a statement of your key finding Use imagery Photos Graphs Diagrams Maps Dont use too many graphs Dont use overly-complicated hard to read graphs Avoid tables where possible Keep them simple if they are used Avoid complicated inaccessible language Broad plain language will be understood by a larger audience Use colour effectively Dont use too many different colours. Pick a couple to design a colour palette/scheme Avoid overly saturated colours Be creative with your medium Can you use interactive screens? Using twitter? Could animate your presentation as a GIF Also think about the information that you include on your poster. What information is going to trigger interesting conversations with your audience? Hypotheses Research Questions Surprising results Important recommendations New theories/models? Ask the audience questions to make them think Tips to engage with your interactions Be prepared in advance to answer any and all questions Include your contact details prominently on your poster Consider printing out smaller hand out versions of your poster Details on where to find the paper and poster online Keep notes with additional notes at hand that you can refer to Advertise your poster beforehand using social media 8.3.4 Some examples Example 1: Our compeition winning twitter poster Authors: Alex Thomson and Emily Nevitt This poster keeps the word count short to less than 300 words, down from a dissertation over 19,000 words, and picks out just two key descriptive findings Maps and an interesting graph dominate the page to draw in the audience. Example 2: RMS Poster Author: Ric Coe A large interesting diagram draws the eye Shows that research and studies is not the only reason to make a poster as this is designed to illustrate key principles, examples and practices. Example 3: CCRP Poster - GIS East Africa Authors: Were K, Macharia PN, Nyamai M, Tanui LK, Okech P, Ngigi MM, Ngigi TG, Onchaga R, Matara S, Odhiambo S and Lali F Again it is kept short and simple with many photos, maps and diagrams used to succinctly illustrate the key messages. Example 4: CCRP Poster - Pigeon Pea FRN Authors: Nganga J, Layatuu E and Keya A A smart use of the traditional design keeping the word count fairly low and choosing plenty of imagery to illustrate the results and methodology. Example 5: CCRP Poster - Sorghum Kenya Authors: F. Wamunga, A. Were, E.J Too, B.O Nyongesa, F.Odiwuor, E. Ouma, S. Gudu Makes use of the traditional design also with good use of imagery and space, very informative and includes all relevant sections. Arguably may include too much text however. 8.3.5 Other resources Colin Purrington Blog filled with plenty of tips, dos and donts and templates Blog Templates Some helpful guides provided by universities New York University University of Reading London School of Economics University of Manchester UC Davis #betterposter campaign Video 1 Video 2 Video 3: Twitter Posters Response Article Whole website devoted to academic research posters Acedemicposter.org PosterPresentations.com Academic Papers Rowe and llic: Rethinking poster presentations at large-scale scienticmeetings  is it time for the format to evolve?

Unfortunately, we are not at all a good representative sample of our future audience because: We already know what the presentation is about Even if we imagine knowing nothing about the content of the presentation, we cant help but imagine someone with a knowledge, background and way of reasoning that is similar to ours and that kind of person cannot be representative of the audience either. So, when we prepare a presentation, it is very important that we make a conscious effort of adapting it to our audience. Otherwise, were likely to lose it at some point or another. Here are the reasons why: Your audience comes with a specific background Some might be researchers, other might be students. They might be working in the same field, but maybe in a different context, or they might also be working on a completely different field. And we need to adapt the presentation to the diversity of the backgrounds. Thats probably the most obvious of the things to be aware of when presenting results. The audience know less than we think they know What I mean by that is not that they know very little. They might actually know a lot about the topic, maybe even more than you, but their knowledge will always come from a perspective and experience that is different from yours. And in the end, they will nearly always be weaker than you think in terms of knowledge that align with your personal approach to things. So when you try and evaluate the knowledge level of your audience, keep in mind that your evaluation is always too optimistic. The audience is not in our brain - we cant assume that a reasoning process that makes sense to us will automatically make sense to them. So, we always need to guide the audience in our reasoning process, even when it seems obvious to us. We are not in the audiences brain either - naturally they will not look exactly where we want them to look at and they will likely be distracted by things that would not necessarily distract us. And so here again, we need to account for it and guide them, so that they stay with us at all time throughout the presentation. 9.4 So what to do? Here are some things you can do to address each the points raised above: 9.4.1 1. Our audience comes with a specific background, different from ours To address the issue of the audience coming with a specific background, - Try to use terms and vocabulary that will be understood by everyone - avoid jargon and acronyms. - Try to put yourself in the shoes of each type of person likely to be there as your audience. And simply ask yourself If I had this particular background, What would help me to follow the presentation? - Be sure to clearly explain all the things without which someone would not be able to follow the presentation. Buuuut I remind you - dont forget about time and so really focus on explaining only the things that are absolutely necessary to follow the presentation. Be very selective about what you say, and when in doubt, skip it. That is -&gt; Say little, but say it very clearly! (and keep the rest for the questions) 9.4.2 2. Our audience know less than we think they know Double-check the key parts of your script. These things that are necessary to follow your presentation. Will someone who has only very basic knowledge about the area be able to follow it? o If youre not totally sure whether something essential in your presentation is clear enough, then its probably not clear enough. Make it clearer. If your presentation becomes too long, rethink what is essential and what is not and skip what is not. 9.4.3 3. Our audience is not in our brain Here are a few recommendation to make sure youre not loosing your audience in your reasoning - Whenever youre talking about a process that is a bit complex, give a very quick overview about the process first, to prepare the audience for what is coming. - Dont hesitate to repeat yourself in order to make your main points and reasoning clear. - Whenever you find yourself thinking well I dont need to say that. It will be clear by looking at the slide, No, this kind of thought is a strong indication that you actually NEED to say that thing. 9.4.4 4. We are not in the audiences brain either I am going to spend a bit more time on this one, because I think it is the point that is the most overlooked, while the actions to address it might be the easiest to implement. - First Make your slides in a way that forces the audience to look at what you want them to look at - that is, limit the number of things on a slide to a minimum, so that the audience doesnt have any choice but to follow the path you decided for them.  For example, if someone was showing me a slide like this one, I would have a lot of choices for things to look at. I could look at the table, the graph, I could try and read the text, the titles and clearly it is not possible that all of these are relevant to what the presenter would be saying at a certain point in time. The presenter can try to direct the audience, but chances are that all these things on the slide will distract them at one point or another from what the presenter is saying. In contrast, if the presenter put these items on different slides, in an order that align with their script, theres nothing to do for the audience but to follow what the presenter wants to show. - Second thing is: Keep the amount of text on slides to a minimum. Having a lot of text is simply THE best way to annoy an audience. Because it is boring, but also because for lots of people it is hard not to read whats in front of them, and since reading and listening at the same time is extremely difficult, these people will not be able to follow what youre saying. And if you need text to help you remember what you have to say, remember that PowerPoint has a note section that is made exactly for that ! So move your script in the note and in the slide, add a picture that illustrates what youre saying. Ideally, you want the picture to be referred to in the script, so that is not just illustrative, but useful! - Third thing that you can do is. When what you put on a slide is a bit complex, first, try to simplify it, and if you cant, then make sure you guide the audience through it. o A good example is graphs. Graphs are always complex, to some degree. there are axes, shapes, colours, numbers, labels many things to look at and they all require some time to be understood. Even if its just for a few seconds, an audience that is trying to understand a graph will not be able to fully focus on what youre saying. So, dont make the audience figure things out on their own. You know that they will spend a moment figuring out the graph anyway, so you might as well go along with that, rather than say something in that moment that they will miss! Do the work for them by guiding them through the components of the graphs each time you have a graph in your slide s; And the same goes for tables. As an example, even with a simple graph like this one, I could be saying something like as you see, the majority of Farmers consider Brachiaria grass to be useful to feed livestock, but then the audience will certainly wonder for a few second if what Im saying is indeed what we see in the graph, to check that, they will need to understand what the axis are and then check the height of the bar. It wont take long, but for a short moment, they wont be focused on what Im saying. Instead it would be much better to help the audience understand the graph first and say something like: In this graph, the height of the bars represent the percentage of farmers who consider Brachiari grass to be useful for a specific use, and on the horizontal axis we have some of those specific uses. So for example About 70 % of farmers consider this grass to be useful for controlling pest. And thats it, I can now continue with the point I want to make, without being worried of loosing my audience. 9.4.5 dshsh Tips: Now I want to finish with a couple of tricks that I believe are useful to help you to follow some of the guidelines discussed here, without really trying to: - The first one is to plan your presentation by imagining that youre explaining things to a 10 year-old kid; its a bit extreme, but it will force you to be clear, only focus on the important, and to guide your audience during the presentation. And let me tell you, if you make a presentation that a 10 year-old kid can follow and understand, you have made a very good presentation! - The second useful tip is to try and do your presentation live, on a piece of paper. Indeed, the issue with slides is that you build them in advance. Its partly an advantage of course, as it allows you to put nice graphs and think about the design but it is also a disadventage because since you dont have the audience in front of you while youre preparing your slides, the idea of guiding the audience becomes something that is not intuitive. In contrast, when you explain something to someone, using a pen and a blank piece of paper, you intuitively guide the person with your pen and write or draw things only when its relevant. If you then plan the order and content of your slides according to how you present things with pen and paper, I assure you that your presentation will likely be very good! Finally Id like to mention Two potential arguments against all the things Ive said and to comment on these: - First is that Planning well and thinking about all of points and suggestions Ive given you is time consuming. And yes, thats true. It is definitely time consuming. And so there is a Balance to find, because Everything is time consuming. But keep in mind that if the audience doesnt understand your presentation, your presentation becomes pointless! - The second thing is an argument for having lots of text and information in the slides rather than keeping these to a minimum to not distract the audience from what youre saying. This argument is that sometimes, power point presentations are also intended to become standalone material. In such situation, one might think that all the information that would be given by the presenter should be in the slides. Well maybe, but Id like to challenge this because there are alternatives. First, as said earlier, you can actually place your full script in the note section, which is part of your PowerPoint file, so if you share your slides, you also share your script. Maybe you can also make a separate version of the slides that is specifically for sharing. And finally what about sharing a recording of the presentation? Now that youre ready to make top notch presentations! Put little text, avoid tables. Choose wording, colours and icons/images very carefully. Icons can be great, but if not chosen carefully they can quickly do more harm than good You may want to keep things extra simple, but more important is making sure that what is shown is intuitive  and careful! Not easy to guess what will be intuitive to farmers  expl: though simple, barcharts might not be so intuitive Provide lots of guidance (obviously), but be very receptive to farmers reactions and adapt to it  spend more time on the things they are interested in, and on the key points where you feel they struggle. Skip the things where you feel they struggle too much though. Try hard that farmers feel related to what is presented: o would help if they took part in experiment or similar experiment o try to present things in a way that is familiar to them  explain how results have been obtained in a way that follows the usual process in a farm for example. o Might be easiest to understand a graph if they can find themselves in the graph - each farmer is represented by a point or a line  and emphasize this by giving examples o focus on the results that are useful for them o keep in mind that sometimes it might be better letting a farmer present the results  in which case you might need to go beyond presenting and provide training to a farmer on presenting the results. 9.5 Other Resources General Our extensive guide which also covers maps GSS  Introduction to Data visualisation Informative Presentation of Tables, Graphs and Statistics Data visualisation examples Tips on effective use of tables and figures in research papers Tufte Principles Blog with accompanying free guide Tables Exporting Tables from R using Flextable, Kable and gt Preparing tables for research papers Formatting Tables in MS word Graphs R Graphics Cookbook Financial Times  Visual Vocabulary Accessibility ONS  Web accessibility Tableau  Colour Blindness Good Examples Reddit - r/dataisbeautiful Bad Examples Reddit - r/dataisugly towardsdatascience.com article "],["show.html", "Chapter 10 Presenting as show and tell 10.1 SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION", " Chapter 10 Presenting as show and tell 10.1 SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION "],["review.html", "Chapter 11 Reviewing, critiquing and improving presentation 11.1 SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION", " Chapter 11 Reviewing, critiquing and improving presentation 11.1 SECTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION "]]
